  // This file was generated automatically from the snippets in the `./snippets/generator/*` directory.
  // These snippets are scoped to this project *only*. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
  // description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope
  // is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is
  // used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
  // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders.
  // Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
  // Example:
  // "Print to console": {
  //  "scope": "javascript,typescript",
  //  "prefix": "log",
  //  "body": [
  //    "console.log('$1');",
  //    "$2"
  //  ],
  //  "description": "Log output to console"
  // }
